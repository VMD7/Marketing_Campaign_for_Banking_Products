Google Colab link - (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1duiEDT-49WZwqWpiWynZz5f8NR2Ukctc?usp=sharing)

This is Internship Studio's internship project. In this project we have to use Machine learning algorithm to predict the customers who can buy a loan. In this project we have to use our prelearned concepts which were tought by the mentor of Internship Studio. I used various algorithms to solve this particular problem. In this firstly i used 

1) Logistic Regression algorithm

2) xgb classifier

3) knn

4) Random forest classifier

5) Neural Network. 

From the above methods Neural Network method gives highest accuracy. 

To use this repository follow the below steps:

a) Using Google Colab- 

One can directly use google colab file. But for that you have to download dataset from link given in file or you can download from Data folder and upload it on Google Drive. Then one can use it in this program.

b) Run in your local Machine.

   1) Download this repository.
   
   2) Upload the .ipynb file in your Jupyter Notebook
   
   3) And run the program.
